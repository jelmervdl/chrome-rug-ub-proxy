# RuG UB Proxy
This plugin shows a page action icon in your address bar. When you click on it, the page will load through the UB proxy of the University of Groningen. Handy want to download papers but are not connected through the university network.

Note that in order to use the university proxy, you need to login into your student or staff account.

# Todo
- Only show page action icon if it makes sense. (I.e. when the University of Groningen is subscribed to the journal you are viewing.)
